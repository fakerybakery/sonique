# Efficient Video BGM Generation (In progress)

A Multi-model tool that designed to help video editors generate background music on video & tv series' transition scene. In addition, it can be used by music composers to generate conditioned music base on instruments, genres, and tempo rate. 

# In-progress: 
- Finetuning the model 
- Working on the gradio demo 
- Adding support for sound effect 
- Improve the generation effiiency. 

The backbone model was base on [stable_audio_tools](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-audio-tools), [Video_LLaMA](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/Video-LLaMA), and [gemma](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it).
